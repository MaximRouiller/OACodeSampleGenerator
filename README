test.js shows the usage of swagger2openapi in NodeJS

traverse.js attempts to do the convertion for all JSON files in azure specifications but currently limits to resources.json files only due to the limitination of swagger2openai.
It also cannot resolve some external refs and internal refs now due to the limination of swagger2openai.
